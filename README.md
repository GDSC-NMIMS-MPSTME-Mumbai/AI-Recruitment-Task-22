### Welcome to the AI Recruitment Task!

Here we will be assessing your logical reasoning and knowledge of AI and most importantly your willingness to learn. 

### Task - Logical Reasoning and Data Handling

**This task consists of 2 questions. You must solve both the questions provided to complete the task.**

<br/>

**Question 1**

Implement a function `StringManipulation(str)`, that accepts a string as the `str` parameter and performs the following operations on it:
   
   1. Every letter in the string should be changed to its **succeeding alphabet** (ie., c becomes d, z becomes a). **Numbers are left unchanged.** _(Hint: lists can be used)_

   2. The string is **inverted after removing all vowels**. _(Reminder: Don't alter the alphabets' case)_
   3. The string has **every alternate character** from the original string _(e.g. for an input “abcdefg”, the output string would be “aceg”)_
   
   Print every output separately and label them appropriately. You may use any programming language to solve this question.
   
   Sample Input:
   
    ComputerProgrammingIsForGeeks1234
    
   Sample Output:
   
    Output1:
    DpnqvufsQsphsbnnjohJpGpsHfflp1234
    
    Output2:
    4321plffHspGpJhjnnbshpsQsfvqnpD
    
    Output3:
    CmuePormigsoGes24

<br/>

**Question 2**

Use the linked [Titanic dataset]() to answer the following questions using python code:
   
   1. **Display only the numeric columns.**
   2. **Remove the null values from column ‘Age’, ‘Fare’.**
   3. **Replace the null values of ‘Age’ and ‘Fare’ with the column mean.**
   
<br/>

**To submit your Solution -**
- Upload Code files for Question1 and Question2, labelled Solution1 and Solution2 to a GitHub repository.
- Create a README file for the repository and add screenshots of the outputs for both the programms to it.
- Feel free to mention any additional information.
- Submit the link to your GitHub repository containing the solution.
   
### Important Guidelines
- **Plagiarism of any sorts will not be entertained.**
- **Your solution to the task must be uploaded to a GitHub repository. You will submit the solution by submitting the link to your GitHub repository containing your solution.**
- **You can find resources on how to create GitHub repositories and commit code [Here](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/).**
- **The README of the repo must contain the required information about the task.**
- **Feel free to make reasonable assumptions and mention them, if any, in the README.**
- **Try to implement as much as you can. You can submit your task even if you are not able to complete it.**
